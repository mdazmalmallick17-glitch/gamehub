Fix the following issues in the existing codebase of my game marketplace website and add required features:

BUG FIX: IMAGE UPLOAD + DISPLAY
----------------------------------------------------
Currently when uploading game images (icons, screenshots, banners, profile pictures), the images do not display properly. Instead, only a small broken icon symbol appears.

Required changes:
1. Replace the current URL input image system with direct drag-and-drop or file upload system.
2. When the user uploads an image, save it to the backend (e.g., /uploads/images directory or cloud storage if available).
3. Store the actual uploaded image path in the database (not as base64 or blank URL).
4. Display uploaded images in full resolution like Google Play Store (rounded corners, full preview).
5. Fix video thumbnail: generate a thumbnail preview and show it on home page instead of blank box.
6. Add automatic thumbnail creation for uploaded video files.

TECH SIGNATURES:
- Use multipart/form-data for uploads.
- Use Express file upload middleware (multer).
- Serve files publicly via `/uploads` static folder.
- Update frontend components to fetch and render real uploaded images.

FEATURE ADD: REPORT SYSTEM + ADMIN INBOX
----------------------------------------------------
Add a reporting system so users can report abusive comments, inappropriate content or users.

Requirements:
1. Add a "Report" button next to comments, messages and profiles.
2. When a report is submitted:
   - store it inside database table: `reports`
   - fields: reportId, reportedByUserId, targetUserId or commentId, reportMessage, dateTime, status('pending')
3. Display all reports inside Admin Dashboard under a new tab called **Inbox Reports**
4. Admin should be able to:
   - read full report text
   - reply to the user
   - delete if resolved
   - block reported user if required

FEATURE: LIKE / DISLIKE SYSTEM + STAR RATING
----------------------------------------------------
Add full working rating system:
- Users can like or dislike any game
- Add star rating 1–5 system
- Display rating average on game card
- Prevent multiple ratings from same user

DATABASE EXAMPLE STRUCTURE
-------------------------------
games
users
comments
likes_dislikes
screenshots
reports

FRONTEND IMPROVEMENTS
-------------------------------
- Ensure text color automatically adjusts to avoid white text on white background or black text on black background using CSS theme variables.
- Game cards should display:
  * Game Icon (real image)
  * Title
  * Description
  * Average Rating stars
  * Download button
  * Like/Dislike count

OUTPUT REQUEST
-------------------------------
Return complete working code including:
- Frontend updated components
- Backend API routes
- Database models
- Multer upload handler
- Admin inbox UI layout
- Image rendering fixes

Make sure no placeholder or incomplete areas remain. Code must be valid and runnable as-is.
