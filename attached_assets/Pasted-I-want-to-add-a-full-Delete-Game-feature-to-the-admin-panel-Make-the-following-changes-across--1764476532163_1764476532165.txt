I want to add a full "Delete Game" feature to the admin panel.  
Make the following changes across the project:

# 1. ADMIN PANEL FRONTEND CHANGES
- Add a visible “Delete Game” button in the admin panel for each game.
- Style it as a red button (danger type).
- When clicked, it must show a confirmation modal:
  "Are you sure you want to permanently delete this game? This action cannot be undone."
- If the admin confirms, send a DELETE request to:
  DELETE /api/games/:id

Example call:
await fetch(`${VITE_API_URL}/api/games/${game.id}`, { method: "DELETE" })

- After deleting:
  ✓ Remove the game from the displayed list instantly without refresh
  ✓ Show a success message “Game deleted successfully”

# 2. BACKEND ROUTE
Create a secure DELETE endpoint:

DELETE /api/games/:id

The route should:
1. Verify the game exists.
2. Delete the game from the database.
3. Also remove associated files:
   - thumbnail
   - screenshots
   - icons
   Files are stored inside ./uploads so remove them using fs.unlinkSync (with try/catch so server doesn't break).
4. Return:
{ success: true, message: "Game deleted successfully" }

# 3. DATABASE
- Remove the game entry completely.
- Remove screenshots array and thumbnail values.
- No leftover orphaned data.

# 4. FILE DELETION LOGIC
Add helper function:

function deleteIfExists(path) {
  if (fs.existsSync(path)) {
      fs.unlinkSync(path);
  }
}

Use this to delete:
uploads/thumbnails/<file>
uploads/screenshots/<file>
uploads/icons/<file>

# 5. SECURITY
- Only admins should be allowed to delete games.
- The DELETE route should check admin session or auth token. If not admin:
return 403 { error: "Unauthorized" }

# 6. OPTIONAL IMPROVEMENTS
Add logging:
console.log(`Game ${id} deleted by admin`)

# 7. TESTING
Ensure:
- deleting a game removes it from UI
- refreshing the page shows it is still gone
- API returns 200 success
- uploaded files on disk are removed

Apply all needed changes to frontend, backend, and routes so this feature works end-to-end.
